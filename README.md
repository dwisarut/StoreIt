# Store-It 

This project is my attempt to create a bare-bones ERP system (AKA an SAP clone) based on my senior year project's exposure, which is also a part of my training to create a CRUD app with MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in HTML, CSS, and pure Javascript. The backend uses MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js with API testing via Insomniac (MERN stack without R).

Initially, this project was planned to have ROP function and notification with authentication, and ROP is one of the valid real-world problems in manufacturing and inventory management. However, I scrapped the idea due to it being too soon to implement such advanced functionality in this project and to avoid my main problem, scope creep, which I'm afraid that it will hinder my learning purpose.

## Learning Outcome

My objective for this project is to learn about how full-stack websites (or web applications) work, which I can divide into three points:

1. Front-end: Client-side logic in pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript (no additional libraries or packages), fetch API, manual DOM manipulation, and event handling.
2. Back-end: Server-side logic in MongoDB (Mongoose), Node.js + Express.js, with POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE methods, asynchronous Javascript, and error handling.
3. Data validation in MongoDB and Mongoose, with a model to structure how the data looks with its own validation rule.

## Note to self

* The MERN stack (without R) that I used today has lots of abstraction; I should further explore how things work underneath in the future.
* Now I know pure Javascript is lots of pain; maybe in the future I should check Svelte out.
* Definitely will explore React.js
