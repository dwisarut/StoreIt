# Store-It 
This project is my attempt to create bare-bone ERP system (AKA SAP clone) based on my senior year project, which is also a part of my training to create CRUD app with MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in HTML, CSS, and pure Javascript. The backend uses MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js with API testing via Insomniac (MERN stack without a R).
